The default configuration will deploy a scaleset with 2 DS1_V2 VMs

The MSI associated with the VMSS will be given reader permission on a storage account that is created by the template

Each VM in the scaleset will write a blob to a container in the storage account, each blob will contain the date and time that the file was created
